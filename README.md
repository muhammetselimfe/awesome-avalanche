# What Is Avalanche?

Avalanche is an open-source platform for building decentralized applications in one
interoperable, decentralized, and highly scalable ecosystem.
Powered by [a uniquely powerful consensus mechanism](https://docs.avax.network/learn/avalanche/avalanche-consensus),
Avalanche is the first ecosystem designed to
accommodate the scale of global finance, with near-instant transaction finality.

## Why Choose Avalanche?

### Blazingly Fast

- Avalanche employs the fastest consensus mechanism of any layer 1 blockchain. The unique consensus
  mechanism enables quick finality and low latency: in less than 2 seconds, your transaction is
  effectively processed and verified.

### Built to Scale

- Developers who build on Avalanche can build application-specific blockchains with complex rulesets
  or build on existing private or public Subnets in any language.
- Avalanche is incredibly energy-efficient and can run easily on consumer-grade hardware.
  The entire Avalanche network consumes the same amount of energy as 46 US households, equivalent to
  0.0005% of the amount of energy consumed by Bitcoin.
- Solidity developers can build on Avalanche's implementation of the EVM straight out-of-the box, or
  build their own custom Virtual Machine (VM) for advanced use cases.

### Advanced Security

- Avalanche consensus scales to thousands of concurrent validators without suffering performance
  degradation making it one of the most secure protocols for internet scaling systems.
- Permissionless and permissioned custom blockchains deployed as an Avalanche Subnets can include custom
  rulesets designed to be compliant with legal and jurisdictional considerations.
